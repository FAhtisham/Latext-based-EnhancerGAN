# Latext-based-EnhancerGAN

This work is the extension of the original Enahcner GAN. LA-based-enhancer-GAN tries to solve the problems faced by 1d Conv based enhancer GAN.


Problems:
- Not every enhancer produced is present in the human genome
- more training time
- Ustable training


LA-based-enhancer-GAN:
- A pretrained AE to learn the continuous representation of AEs]
- Less training data 
- Less training time
- More accurate learning of Enhancer regions
